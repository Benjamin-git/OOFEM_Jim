\section Introduction Introduction
The idea of OOFEMlib is to provide to the FEM analyst highly modular,
easily extensible and robust enviroment. It can be also thought as an general
FEM kernel of general FE program.

    Here is a list of highlights:
<UL>    
<LI>object oriented architecture</LI>
<LI>modular and extensible FEM kernel (OOFEMlib)
          fully extensible - The kernel is extensible in any "direction". The possibility of
          adding new element type, new material model with any type and number of internal
          history parameters, new boundary condition, new numerical algorithm or new
          analysis module is matter of course.</LI>
<LI>independent problem formulation, numerical solution and data storage  -
          The kernel provides the independent abstractions for analysis, general numerical
          method and data storage (sparse matrices). The component mapping concept
          allows to formulate problem and numerical method independently and allows to use
          any suitable numerical method for problem solution without changes. This concept is
          further enhanced by abstract sparse matrix interface, allowing to formulate
          numerical method independently on sparse matrix implementation.</LI>
<LI>full restart support - The kernel supports full restart from any previously saved
          state.</LI>
<LI>support for parallel processing (message passing) - General classes for
          efficient inter domain communication are provided  built over the abstract general
          layer for message passing libraries, which is available on many parallel platforms
          (massively parallel computers, shared memory systems and workstation clusters) .</LI>
<LI>adaptive analysis support - multiple domain concept, fast spatial localization algorithms 
    based on tree techniques are available.</LI>
<LI>includes enhanced support for structural analysis.</LI>
</UL>
