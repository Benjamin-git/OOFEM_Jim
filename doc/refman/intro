\section Introduction Introduction
The idea of OOFEM is to provide to the FEM analyst highly modular,
easily extensible and robust enviroment. 
The OOFEM is built on the top of OOFEMlib - the general purpose FE kernel.

Here is a list of OOFEMlib highlights:
<UL>    
<LI>object oriented architecture</LI>
<LI>modular and extensible FEM kernel (OOFEMlib)
          fully extensible - The kernel is extensible in any "direction". The possibility of
          adding new element type, new material model with any type and number of internal
          history parameters, new boundary condition, new numerical algorithm or new
          analysis module is matter of course.</LI>
<LI>independent problem formulation, numerical solution and data storage  -
          The kernel provides the independent abstractions for analysis, general numerical
          method and data storage (sparse matrices). The component mapping concept
          allows to formulate problem and numerical method independently and allows to use
          any suitable numerical method for problem solution without changes. This concept is
          further enhanced by abstract sparse matrix interface, allowing to formulate
          numerical method independently on sparse matrix implementation.</LI>
<LI>full restart support - The kernel supports full restart from any previously saved
          state.</LI>
<LI>support for parallel processing (message passing) - General classes for
          efficient inter domain communication are provided  built over the abstract general
          layer for message passing libraries, which is available on many parallel platforms
          (massively parallel computers, shared memory systems and workstation clusters) .</LI>
<LI>adaptive analysis support - multiple domain concept, fast spatial localization algorithms 
					based on tree techniques are available.</LI>
<LI>includes enhanced support for structural analysis.</LI>
</UL>

<p>The OOFEM code, built on the top of OOFEMlib, consist of different modules. 
Currently, only structural analysis module is
under development. The OOFEM features include:
<UL>
<LI>Structural Mechanics module </LI>
<UL>
<LI> many analysis procedures - linear statics, linear dynamics (eigen value analysis, direct
     integration methods - implicit and explicit), nonlinear statics (robust CALM solver),
     nonlinear dynamics (explicit, parallel version) </LI>
<LI> large element and material libraries - see %Element Library Manual and %Material
     Model Library Manual</LI>
<LI> advanced modeling features  - slave DOFs, rigid arms, local coordinate systems and
     many more</LI>
<LI> parallel analysis - explicit nonlinear dynamics utilizing  the %Domain Decomposition
     Method, pilot implementation of implicit solver (FETI)</LI>
<LI> profile optimization (Sloan)</LI>
</UL>
<LI> X-Windows postprocessing </LI>
<LI> parallel processing - utilizes the %Domain Decomposition Method for dramatic performance
     scalability on various parallel architectures (explicit dynamics)</LI>
<LI> portability (C++) </LI>
<LI> comparable computational performance </LI>
</UL>
